Updated Shoulda snippets with the new syntax (A work in progress as I code).
I'm also improving them here and there.

Version 0.3 by David Lowenfels

The syntax and preferences are based on the RSpec bundle.
The snippets were contributed by Dan Croak and Sam Livingston-Gray, and mashed up by me.
I modified the Ruby bundle’s “run focused unit test” to support the shoulda syntax.
